The source code for *GRASP: Generic Framework for Health Status Representation Learning Based on Incorporating Knowledge from Similar Patients*

Thanks for your interest in our work!

## Visualization Tool
Welcome to try the prototype of our visualization tool (AdaCare):

http://47.93.42.104/318 (Cause of death: GI disease)   
http://47.93.42.104/616 (Cause of death: Other)   
http://47.93.42.104/265 (Cause of death: GI disease)    
http://47.93.42.104/812 (Cause of death: Cachexia)

AdaCare can be found [here](https://github.com/Accountable-Machine-Intelligence/AdaCare), which is our another work in AAAI-2020.

Welcome to test the prototype of our visualization tool. The clinical hidden status is built by our latest representation learning model ConCare.
The internationalised multi-language support will be available soon.

## Requirements

* Install python, pytorch. We use Python 3.7.3, Pytorch 1.5.0.
* If you plan to use GPU computation, install CUDA

## Data preparation
The raw data for PhysioNet Dataset are open according to [here](https://journals.lww.com/ccmjournal/Fulltext/2020/02000/Early_Prediction_of_Sepsis_From_Clinical_Data__The.10.aspx)


## Run GRASP

All the hyper-parameters and steps are included in the `.ipynb` file, you can run it directly.
